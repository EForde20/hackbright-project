# IngrediYUM

**What is IngrediYUM?**

IngrediYUM provides the hungry user with an all-in-one tool to discover recipes, compile shopping lists, and monitor ingredients. Integration of the Spoonacular API allows the user to search for recipes they want to cook. The user can then generate shopping lists with aggregated and categorized ingredients to make grocery shopping more convenient. As the user confirms ingredients purchased and recipes cooked, IngrediYUM will calculate the new ingredient amounts accordingly in the userâ€™s current inventory. Lastly, the user can search for recipes by items in their inventory and generate shopping lists with missing ingredients to make it easy to make use of leftovers.
