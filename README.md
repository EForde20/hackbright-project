# IngrediYUM

IngrediYUM provides the hungry user with an all-in-one tool to discover recipes, compile shopping lists, and monitor ingredients. Integration of the Spoonacular API allows the user to search for recipes they want to cook. The user can then generate shopping lists with aggregated and categorized ingredients to make grocery shopping more convenient. As the user confirms ingredients purchased and recipes cooked, IngrediYUM will calculate the new ingredient amounts accordingly in the userâ€™s current inventory. Lastly, the user can search for recipes by items in their inventory and generate shopping lists with missing ingredients to make it easy to make use of leftovers.

This Flask application has a home page with a form for new users to sign up and a button for returning users to log in.<br>
Passwords are hashed and salted before storing in the PostgreSQL database.

After the user logs in, a dashboard utilizing 3 SQLAlchemy queries displays the user's current inventory, pending shopping lists, and selected recipes to cook.<br>

A new user is assumed to not have existing inventory.<br>
The user can search for a new recipe by clicking on the "Search for New Recipe" button.

When the form is submitted, the server makes a call to the Spoonacular API using the user's inputs.
